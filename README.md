In this challenge, you'll implement a small web app that runs basic text analytics on user submitted text. We provide initial HTML and CSS files, and you'll be responsible for adding CSS classes to the HTML for your JavaScript code to hook into, and for writing JavaScript code that computes and displays 3 metrics:

-Total word count of the submitted text
-Unique word count of the submitted text
-Average word length in characters of the submitted text

The program should print each of these metrics in the appropriate area in the results section.

Here are some pointers to get you started:

-You need to link to jQuery in the index.html file

-You need to link to app.js in index.html

-In the HTML file, the results section defaults to having a .hidden class applied. Your application code will need to remove that class when it's time   to display results.

You'll need to add CSS classes for your DOM manipulation layer to target (and use the js- prefix!)
